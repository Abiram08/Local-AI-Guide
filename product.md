### OPTIMIZATION RULES

#### Time Optimization
**Rule**: Minimize travel time between activities

**Algorithm**:
```
For each activity pair:
  Calculate travel time
  If travel_time > 30 minutes:
    Find closer alternative
  Else:
    Keep in itinerary
```

**Example**:
- Activity 1: Baga Beach (North Goa)
- Activity 2: Palolem Beach (South Goa) - 60 km, 90 min
- **Optimization**: Replace with Calangute Beach (5 km, 10 min)

---

#### Budget Optimization
**Rule**: Maximize value within budget

**Algorithm**:
```
Sort activities by value_score:
  value_score = (experience_rating × interest_match) / cost
Select top activities until budget reached
Reserve 20% budget for contingencies
```

**Example**:
- Budget: ₹5000
- Reserved: ₹1000 (contingency)
- Available: ₹4000
- Select activities totaling ₹3800
- Remaining: ₹1200 (buffer)

---

#### Crowd Optimization
**Rule**: Avoid peak times when possible

**Algorithm**:
```
For each venue:
  Check crowd prediction
  If predicted_crowd > CROWDED:
    Suggest alternative time OR
    Suggest alternative venue
```

**Example**:
- Basilica at 3 PM Sunday: 1400 people (VERY CROWDED)
- **Optimization**: Suggest 9 AM Monday: 200 people (LOW)
