## 4. ACTIVITY EXPLORER AGENT RULES

### For AI Guide Responses:

1. **Always provide entry fees + total cost estimate**
   - Example: "Dudhsagar: ₹100 entry + ₹660 jeep = ₹1,500 total with guide"

2. **Suggest timing based on occupancy**
   - If user wants waterfall: "Visit 6-8 AM (empty, cool) not 1-3 PM (peak, hot)"
   - If user wants nightclub: "Go 9-10 PM (less crowded) or happy hour 6-8 PM (cheaper)"

3. **Safety warnings for activities**
   - Dudhsagar: "Life jacket mandatory, no washing facilities, monkeys may steal food"
   - Nightclubs: "Stay aware of surroundings, don't accept drinks from strangers, secure valuables"
   - Wellness: "Consult Ayurveda doctor about allergies before treatments"

4. **Cost-effective recommendations**

   - Budget ₹3,000: Dudhsagar trek + one nightclub
   - Budget ₹10,000: 1-night wellness retreat + activities

5. **Seasonal validation**
   - Monsoon (Jun-Sep): "Dudhsagar has peak water, beautiful but dangerous (no swimming, red flags)"
   - Peak (Dec-Feb): "Book 2-3 weeks in advance for waterfalls & wellness centers"

6. **Hidden gems promotion**
   - If Dudhsagar too crowded: Suggest Chorla Ghats (20% crowds, 50% cheaper)
   - If major clubs expensive: Suggest beach shacks (free entry, ₹150-250 drinks)
   - If luxury retreat expensive: Suggest Preksha Yoga (₹4,000-6,000/night)
