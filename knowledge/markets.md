### Bargaining Strategy for Anjuna

**Golden Rule:** Sellers expect 40-60% negotiation. First price is rarely final.

**Step-by-Step Bargaining:**
1. **Initial Offer:** Ask price = ₹1,000. Your start = ₹400 (40% rule)
2. **Counter 1:** Seller says ₹900. You offer ₹450
3. **Counter 2:** Seller says ₹750. You offer ₹550
4. **Final:** Land at ₹600-650 (65% of asking)
   - Time: 5-10 minutes per item
   - Success rate: 80-90%

**Bargaining Do's & Don'ts:**
- ✅ DO smile, build rapport, ask for discounts on bulk purchases
- ✅ DO show cash (increases flexibility 10-15%)
- ✅ DO bargain on expensive items (₹1000+), less on ₹100-300 items
- ✅ DO walk away (sellers often call you back with better price)
- ❌ DON'T bargain after 6 PM (vendors reluctant, time-sensitive)
- ❌ DON'T lowball unreasonably (respect for craftsmanship)
- ❌ DON'T show too much interest (gives seller advantage)
