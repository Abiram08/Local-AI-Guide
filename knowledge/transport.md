### Peak Season vs Off-Season Pricing

| Route | Distance | Official Rate | Private Taxi (Off-Season) | Private Taxi (Peak Season) | Markup % |
|-------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|

| Panaji → Candolim | 10 km | ₹290 | ₹400-₹500 | ₹800-₹1,200 | 175-315% |

**Negotiation Tips**:
- Pre-book 24 hours in advance for better rates
- Ask for "rate card" before getting in—insist on written fare agreement
- Ride-sharing (e.g., 4 passengers) reduces per-person cost by 25-40%
- Off-season (May-September) has 30-40% lower fares
- Early morning (6-8 AM) and late night (11 PM-5 AM) negotiable rates

| **Motorcycle Taxi** | ₹14 | ₹5 | ₹2 per 10 mins or ₹15/hr | 25% surcharge | 50% surcharge |

## Night Travel & Surcharges

### Night Taxi Surcharges (Official vs Reality)

#### Official Night Tariff (11 PM - 5 AM)

According to Goa State Transport Authority[50][62]:

| Surcharge Type | Official Rate |
|----------|-------|
| **Night Hourly Charge** | ₹100/hour |
| **Night Surcharge % (11 PM-5 AM)** | 35% on total fare |
| **Example Calc** | ₹1,000 daytime fare × 1.35 = ₹1,350 at night |

Most private taxi operators charge:
- **25% surcharge** (off-season, negotiable)
- **50-100% surcharge** (peak season, non-negotiable)
- Some charge **minimum ₹300-₹500 extra** regardless of distance

## Transport Safety & Logistics Tips

### General Transport Safety

#### Road Safety
1. **Helmet Mandatory**: For bikes/scooters; fines ₹1,000+ if not worn
2. **Speed Limits**: 40-60 km/hr on highways; 30 km/hr in cities
3. **Driving License**: Valid international/Indian license required; carry original documents
4. **Avoid Night Drives**: Most accidents occur 10 PM-6 AM; if necessary, book a driver
5. **Road Conditions**: Monsoon (June-Sept) = potholes and slippery roads; drive carefully

#### Taxi/Rickshaw Safety
- **Pre-Book When Possible**: GoaMiles app safer than street hails
- **Share Taxi Number**: Text/WhatsApp taxi registration to a friend
- **Verify Driver**: Check name on GoaMiles app matches person
- **Don't Accept Overquotes**: If driver quotes 300% above standard, politely decline
- **Payment Method**: Prefer digital payment (no cash flash); keep emergency cash separate

### Common Transport Scams & How to Avoid

#### Scam #1: Broken Meter in Auto-Rickshaw
- **How It Works**: Meter "broken," driver quotes inflated fare
- **Prevention**: Always confirm fare before boarding, or use GoaMiles auto option
- **If Caught**: Refer to government regulated rates; offer legal maximum

#### Scam #2: "Detour for Better Road"
- **How It Works**: Taxi driver takes longer route claiming main road blocked
- **Prevention**: Check Google Maps before ride; know your destination route
- **If Caught**: Politely insist on direct route; threaten to report on GoaMiles

#### Scam #3: Fake Checkpoints
- **How It Works**: "Police" demand license/documents at night, ask for bribes
- **Prevention**: Genuine checkpoints have barriers; always verify official IDs
- **If Caught**: Refuse to give money; ask for written fine; report registration

#### Scam #4: Surprise Ferry/Toll Charges
- **How It Works**: Driver doesn't tell you about ₹50-₹100 ferry/toll, adds to bill
- **Prevention**: Ask upfront: "Are there any additional charges (ferry, toll, parking)?"
- **If Caught**: Refer to official taxi rate card (note: toll/ferry not included in baseline fare)

#### Scam #5: Wrong Bike Returned
- **How It Works**: Rental shop claims you damaged bike that was already damaged
- **Prevention**: Video/photograph every scratch BEFORE pickup and AFTER return
- **If Caught**: Show photos/video evidence; escalate to rental platform/police
