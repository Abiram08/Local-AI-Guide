## Local Intelligence: Unspoken Rules

### The Goan Dining Etiquette
1. **"Sussegado" Culture**: Goa operates on "sussegado" (leisurely, unhurried) pace. Never rush a meal. Enjoy the rhythm of the beach
2. **Feni Philosophy**: Local spirit (feni) with soda is customary. Accept offers graciously even if declining
3. **Family Matters**: Many restaurants are family-run for generations. Show respect to owners—ask about their specialty or family story
4. **Off-Menu Magic**: Most authentic places have unwritten "off-menu" specials based on daily catch. Always ask: "What's special today?"
5. **Beach Shack Etiquette**: Sunbeds and shade are shared resources. Leave your belongings at the table only
6. **Spice Level**: Goan food can be VERY spicy. Ask servers to adjust heat level; they respect this and won't judge

### Local Knowledge (Unspoken Rules)
- **"Ask for reachado"**: Mackerel recheado is so popular that some places only make it by request (not on menu)
- **Fish by the Pound**: At beach shacks, fish is priced by weight. Ask price per 100g before ordering
- **Poi Preference**: Traditional Goan poi bread is preferred by locals over rice. Asking for poi shows you know Goan food
- **Happy Hour**: Some shacks don't advertise happy hours—ask locals for timings
- **Seasonal Fish**: Monsoon = best mackerel and sardines; Winter = best pomfret and kingfish
- **Local Drinks**: Order "Kokum sherbet" (kokum fruit drink) or "Sol Kadhi" (coconut-based) instead of sugary sodas—locals' choice
- **"Chonak" Style**: Fish cooked "chonak style" (fried, not curried) is how locals eat it most

## Safety Warnings & Best Practices

### Menu Pricing Scams
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Always ask for a printed menu with prices before ordering, especially at beach shacks
- **Red Flag**: Unmarked menu or "just ask us for price" = potential overcharging
- **Protection**: Request menu with prices in writing
- **Dispute Strategy**: Politely refuse if final bill exceeds 20% of expected price; offer to split the difference
- **Local Exception**: Well-established shacks (Britto's, Souza Lobo, Martin's Corner) have transparent pricing

### Seafood Safety
- **Freshness Check**: Ask "When was this caught?" Fish should be caught same day
- **Fish Type**: Confirm fish type before ordering (pomfret vs kingfish = different prices)
- **Weight Pricing**: Always ask weight price upfront; don't accept verbal estimates
- **Avoid Summer Raw Fish**: During hot months (April-May), avoid raw fish dishes; stick to cooked

### Health & Hygiene
- **Water Safety**: Always drink bottled water (restaurants use filtered water, but be cautious with ice)
- **Hand Washing**: Observe food preparation cleanliness; avoid shacks with visibly poor hygiene
- **Stomach Issues**: If you get food poisoning, stay hydrated with ORS (oral rehydration salts—available at all pharmacies)
- **Restaurant Standards**: Established restaurants maintain better hygiene; street food carries higher risk but is generally safe if busy (high turnover = fresh food)

### Behavioral Safety
- **Solo Diners**: Eat at popular, well-lit shacks; avoid isolated beaches after dark
- **Valuables**: Never leave phones/wallets unattended; use hotel lockers
- **Aggressive Vendors**: Polite but firm "no, thank you" works best
- **Cash Handling**: Keep cash secured; don't flash large amounts
- **Night Dining**: Stick to main beach shacks or restaurants; avoid backroad eateries after 9 PM

### Allergies & Dietary Restrictions
- **Seafood Allergies**: ALWAYS inform staff; contamination risk in shared kitchens
- **Vegetarian**: Specify "absolutely no seafood stock/oil" to avoid cross-contamination
- **Nut Allergies**: Coconut is used extensively; inform staff if allergic
- **Spice Tolerance**: Ask for mild/medium/spicy explicitly; default is VERY spicy

### Seasonal Warnings
- **Monsoon (June-Sept)**: Fresh fish limited; some shacks close; flooding possible
- **Jellyfish Season (April-May, Sept-Oct)**: Avoid beach swimming; eat but don't swim
- **Peak Season (Nov-Feb)**: Reserve ahead; prices peak; expect crowds
- **Summer (March-May)**: Extreme heat; eat early (lunch by 1 PM); dehydration risk

### Regulatory Compliance
- **Goa Shack Policy 2024**: All licensed beach shacks must display health certificates

### Pro Tips

✓ **Visit during lunch** for better prices and local atmosphere  
✓ **Befriend staff** for future discounts and special treatment  
✓ **Download offline maps** (Google Maps offline feature) for navigation  
✓ **Carry small cash** for street food and tips (many places don't accept cards)  
✓ **Learn basic Konkani** ("Thank you" = "Dhanyavaad"; "Delicious" = "Khup changu")  
✓ **Take business cards** from favorite restaurants; reference them later for repeat visits
