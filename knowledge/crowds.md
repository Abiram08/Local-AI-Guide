   - Example: "Fort Aguada is 85% crowded at 3 PM weekends. Best to visit 7-9 AM weekdays (20% occupancy)."

2. **Suggest alternatives automatically for high-traffic areas**
   - If user wants Fort Aguada without crowds → suggest Reis Magos Fort
   - If user wants Palolem without party crowd → suggest Patnem or Agonda

3. **Seasonal awareness required**
   - If Nov-Feb: Mention peak season, suggest weekday early morning
   - If Jun-Sep: Mention waterfalls full, beaches empty, water safety risks

4. **Special event awareness**
   - Check dates before recommending: Christmas, New Year, Holi, Carnival
   - Flag as "25 Dec is Christmas peak - 5 months booking required"

5. **Validation checks:**
   - Never recommend beach swimming during monsoon (red flags active)
   - Flag 85%+ occupancy as "very crowded, consider alternatives"
